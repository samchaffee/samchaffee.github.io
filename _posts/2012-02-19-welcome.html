Welcome to the inaugural post of <a title="Home" href="/">samchaffee.com</a>! I'm excited to finally bring this blog to life. My hope for it is (at least) two-fold: 1) share some things I've learned about developing in <a title="Moodle" href="http://moodle.org">Moodle</a> and 2) bring readers along on my journey of exploring new/existing web technologies that I find interesting. Hopes aside, who knows where it will lead. I'll be satisfied if I've learned something or helped someone else learn something along the way.
